## About Me

I’m a PhD researcher in elementary particle theory, working on dark matter models, particle phenomenology, and exploring new ideas beyond the Standard Model. My work is driven by a curiosity to understand the universe at its most fundamental level.

Any inquiries, collaboration opportunities, or discussions related to my research are welcome. Feel free to connect—let’s explore the infinite wonders of theoretical physics together.
